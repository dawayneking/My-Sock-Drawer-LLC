# My-Sock-Drawer-LLC
### This will serve to show the progress that I am making towards my business and passion to the love of socks. I am using my background in engineering to accomplish my goal of providing a perfect sock, with stylish design, comfortability, and mental health in mind. Everyone deserves to feel good just as well as looking good. 
## What I intend on accomplishing with this:
- Being able to keep track of my progress and have it as open source for others that want to follow my progress as well.  
- Being able to reference my own work in a single place, as I have been losing notes and valuable documents through life circumstances I have faced over the few years.  
- Learn how to better use and navigate Github and the tools that they offer to users.  
- Increase the technical knowledge and add to my repertoire of skills, building on engineering and technical skills learned outside the classroom.  
  - I have a background engineering, but didn't finish college when I was a traditional student.
  - I haven't finished, and have been on and off; so I hope to finish someday, but you never stop learning and building upon skills from before.  
- Make money from my personal business, My Sock Drawer, LLC., registered with the State of Florida on [SunBiz](https://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/corporationsearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&directionType=Initial&searchNameOrder=MYSOCKDRAWER%20L250000561400&aggregateId=flal-l25000056140-7a7278b1-c21f-431c-a028-19297c4df8aa&searchTerm=MYSOCKBROKER.COM%20LLC&listNameOrder=MYSOCKBROKERCOM%20L180000918470).
## About My Sock Drawer, LLC
I have always had a passion for socks. My Sock Drawer, LLC is just that. A double entendre or wordplay to describe socks that I would keep in My Sock Drawer. The business came about from everyone jokingly wanting my socks, so I sold a few new identical pairs that I kept in My Sock Drawer. Even when I was down bad, and mentally not there, it always made me feel good when I received a compliment on my socks. Therefore, the mission of the company is "To Bring Joy And Happiness With The Creativity Through Socks."  In the future, I would love to be able to give socks to encourage mental health, and donate to charitable organizations including homeless shelters. Everyone deserves a pickmeup. 

## Why Socks
Most people don't understand the importance of a good quality sock. Socks provide the protection and comfort for shoes we wear everyday, but also functions to improve foot health, and control moisture from continuous use.

### Facts About Your Feet
Feet are commonly known to support simple functions of our everyday lives such as standing, moving around, and supporting the balance and preventing shock for the body daily. Each foot contrains 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 muscle, tendons, or ligaments. There are nerves which make you feel. From when we are born, our feet are constantly changing, from size to support, we have to take care of them. Most people have two, but they are equally important; so socks are sold in pairs. 

### Focus on Your Feet!  
No really... In March 2023, The National Institutes of Health published an article called "[Focus on Your Feet!](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2023/03/focus-your-feet)", and provided Steps to Protect Foot Health. 


## Why make a blog for Github
Currently I am funding all operations and ideas, as well as products; so I am challenging myself to use my technical skills to grow my company. I did try and start a non profit on digital marketing, but I may as well use all the skills and ideas I intended to teach kids around the neighborhood to get to the next level. I learned basic forms of Search Engine Optimization trying to grow my personal website, formerly "Dawayneking.com". Now I just tell people to google me to save the yearly fee, and just to flex the fact that I am on google. I also rather get more search inquires on the world wide web through search engines, so things I don't want to pop up show lower in relevancy. 

The socks I sell are things I would have in My Sock Drawer. When shopping for Socks, I take heed to certain attributes such as comfort, style, material, cost, and a wide range of variable factors. I wouldn't see anyone something that I wouldn't wear, or give to a gift to a friend I know personally. I don't currently create my own sock yet, but I am using the products I carry to conduct market research for when I come out with my own. 
  - For example, currently I hold over ten brands of socks in my inventory including:
