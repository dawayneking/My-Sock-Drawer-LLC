# My-Sock-Drawer-LLC
### This will serve to show the progress that I am making towards my business and passion to the love of socks. I am using my background in engineering to accomplish my goal of providing a perfect sock, with stylish design, comfortability, and mental health in mind. Everyone deserves to feel good just as well as looking good. 
## What I intend on accomplishing with this:
  Being able to keep track of my progress and have it as open source for others that want to follow my progress as well.  
  Being able to reference my own work in a single place, as I have been losing notes and valuable documents through life circumstances I have faced over the few years.  
  Learn how to better use and navigate Github and the tools that they offer to users.  
  Increase the technical knowledge and add to my repertoire of skills, building on engineering and technical skills learned outside the classroom.  
    I have a background engineering, but didn't finish college when I was a traditional student. I haven't finished, and have been on and off; so I hope to finish someday, but you never stop learning and building upon skills from before.
